		That I, King Timmy will be at your service anytime my attrntion is needed. 
		<br>
		<br>
		 Sometimes you do not have to give up on your dreams you just have to
		 <br>
		 <br>
		  talk to someone who has gone through same things as you or probably a
		  <br>
		  <br> 
		   professional motivational speaker like myself.
		</p>
		<p class="contpp">
			Most atimes walking throught the part of self discovery is quite lonely, difficult,
			<br>
			<br>
			 self consuming and in some extreme cases depressing. I always tell younger
			 <br>
			 <br>
			  people that thinking about a plan is a mental(abstract) step that will begin your
			  <br>
			  <br>
			   physical step which might just put you in motion to your actual dream. It does'nt
			   <br>
			   <br>
			    matter how hard the path you are taking is, two major questions you should ask
			    
			     yourself are
		</p>
		<p  class="sick">	
			<ul>
				<li>Who are the people in this line before me, like your mentors?</li>
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>How great are they?</li>
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>do you aspire to get to the height of their greatness?</li>
				<br><br>	

			<li>(Quite a discouraging one but very necessary too) Is my capacity enough to do the work and take the risks they took to get there? (In most cases you can be like 	Ronaldo if you want it just bad enough, there are very little limits how body and minds have especially when another human has been there before) </li>
